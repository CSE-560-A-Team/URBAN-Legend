/**
 * The Instruction class is the do-all, see-all, have-all class for instruction
 * use and representation.
 * 
 * This class is both a descriptor class and a storage class. It represents the
 * main mechanisms for tokenizing, lexing, and assembling URBAN code.
 * 
 * The Instruction class is designed such that every module of the
 * Assemblernator can utilize it in some form or another.
 * 
 * These modules can interact with it in two ways, depending on what is
 * available:
 * 
 * First, they can interface with it using a static (or singleton) instance
 * obtained via getInstance(). These singleton instances have no context in a
 * particular piece of code; they are used for methods that would otherwise be
 * static if we could look up static instances. It is from these instances of
 * Instruction that methods such as getNewInstance() and execute() are most
 * likely to be called (though they are still valid for other instances, it is
 * the static instance which will be most handy).
 * 
 * Second, modules can interface with Instructions that were pulled from code.
 * These instances of Instruction are obtained using the static method
 * Instruction.parse(). It is for these instances of Instruction that the
 * check() and assemble() methods are valid.

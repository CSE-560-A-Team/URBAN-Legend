# This is a comprehensive list of all errors generated by this assembler.
testError = This is a sample error message, generated %0 by %1

# Errors used in Instruction::parse()
labelNotCol0 = URBAN specification says labels must start at column 0 (`%0' is not a %1 instruction)
expectOpBefore = Expected operand keyword before '%0' symbol
notOperand = Unrecognized operand keyword `%0'
expectOpColon = Expected colon following `%0' keyword
Unexpected symbol `%0' following %1
instrUnknown = `%0' is not a known instruction
instrInvalid = `%0' is not a valid instruction

# General purpose operand errors
directiveMissingOp = Missing `%1' operand to `%0' directive
instructionMissingOp = Missing `%1' operand to `%0' instruction
extraOperandsDir = Too many operands to `%0' directive
operandInsWrong = `%0' instruction cannot use `%1' operand.
operandDirWrong = `%0' directive cannot use `%1' operand.
operandInsNeedAdd = `%0' instruction requires `%1' operand in addition to `%2'.
extraOperandsIns = Too many operands to `%0' directive
extraOperands = Too many operands provided


# Operand-specific errors
STstringCount = Operand `ST' must contain precisely one string in this context
MEMoutRange = Operand `%0' must be within range: [0, 4095].
INDEXoutRange = Operand `%0' must be within range: [1, 7].
FLoutRange = Operand `FL' must be within range: [-2^12, (2^12) - 1].
